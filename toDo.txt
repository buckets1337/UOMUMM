Geography

x 'area' and 'room' objects, to begin defining the world.  The area objects should be very simple, nothing more than containers for other areas and rooms, with stats.  Right now I envision areas defined by directories, while rooms will be files.  However, I think each area will need an 'area stats' file to keep track of it's state.  Simple organization like this, with nesting, should prove flexible in the future.
x room exits
x place the player in a room on connection
x players need to beging keeping track of what room they are in
x simple movement commands
x rooms need to be added to the saveManager.  Right now, they are not saved. This causes issues when a server restarts, because the data that the areas are loaded from contains no rooms, even though the blueprint did.


Chat

x whitelisting for channels
x blacklisting for channels

- optional password protection on chat channels
- default chat channels (global chat)
- need to expire old unused chat channels, and need ability to set a chat channel to not expire
- bug where string names consisting only of spaces can be added to whitelists and blacklists.
- whitelists and blacklists should check that a player is online before adding them
- players should be able to block other players entirely


Display

x a basic room display, that is shown automatically on room entrance
- description and long description viewing commands


BUGS *(- -)
x directory path for area saving is messed up, all directories saving directly to 'world', and a 'world' directory is being created in 'world'.  Basically, path is being ignored.

x players are not gaining a currentRoom sometimes on connecting
x related to above, exits not linking properly in some rooms
