# ideas for things to add

- 'area' and 'room' objects, to begin defining the world.  The area objects should be very simple, nothing more than containers for other areas and rooms, with stats.  Right now I envision areas defined by directories, while rooms will be files.  However, I think each area will need an 'area stats' file to keep track of it's state.  Simple organization like this, with nesting, should prove flexible in the future.
- room exits
- simple movement commands

- optional password protection on chat channels
- default chat channels (global chat)
- need to expire old unused chat channels, and need ability to set a chat channel to not expire
